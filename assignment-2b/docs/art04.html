            <p>Game preparation</p>
            <p>Before starting a round, a player can search for teammates and opponents using an automatic matchmaking system. Alternatively, for a free game, a player can search for his teammates manually or invite them from his friends list. In this case, the matchmaking system is not used. Once enough players have been found for both teams (five per team in classic mode), all players in the match enter the champion selection together. Here, each player can select his desired champion, a game character with individual abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The player thereby fulfills the role of the summoner, who summons and controls this figure. Depending on the game mode, all players can choose at the same time or alternately per team. In alternating selection mode, one champion can also be "banished" from each of the 5 members of each team prior to selection. Banned champions cannot be selected by any of the teams. In addition to the champion, two summoner spells can be selected for use in the game. These are independent of the chosen champion. In addition, various skill enhancements, the runes, can be selected to adapt the champion to the individual game strategy.</p>
            <p>Gameplay</p>
            <p>The playing field itself is divided into two similar halves, each of which is assigned to a team. Depending on the map and game mode, there are several paths between the two halves of the map. The paths are generally referred to as lanes in game jargon, with the area between them often summarized as the "jungle". In this are various neutral monsters (not belonging to any team), i.e. members of both teams can defeat them. Some of these monsters grant a champion - in addition to experience and gold - unique, time-limited enhancements. The playing field is only revealed at the places where a player, a tower, minions or a so-called "eye" (English ward) of the own team is currently located. An eye is a one-time use item that creates a small area of visibility for a limited time. The rest is hidden in the so-called fog of war, i.e. not visible to players. Two teams of usually five players compete against each other. The two teams start on opposite sides of a map near a main building called the Nexus. The goal is to destroy the opposing Nexus. The Nexus is defended by the opposing team as well as computer-controlled units and towers. The minions are sent in the direction of the enemy main building and follow the respective "lanes", they do not run through the "jungle". They also attack every enemy unit and building on their way to the enemy Nexus. There are inhibitors in addition to the nexus. If they are destroyed, stronger minions will appear on the opposite side of the corresponding "lane" - so-called supervassals. After several minutes, the inhibitors are rebuilt and the supervassals of the respective lane are no longer summoned. To prevent the game from progressing too quickly, the nexus cannot be attacked directly. First, on at least one "lane", all enemy towers, the outer, inner and the inhibitor tower, as well as the inhibitor itself, must be destroyed. Then the two nexus towers, which are independent of a "lane", become attackable, and only after their destruction can the nexus also be attacked. By killing minions, monsters, enemy champions and destroying enemy towers, your own champion gains experience, i.e. they reach a higher level where new abilities can be unlocked or these can be improved, whereby these are determined by the respective champion and are not completely freely selectable.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, various basic attributes of the respective champion are improved. In addition, there is still a certain amount of gold for players who perform the killing blow on an enemy unit. In order to balance the two teams, a bounty is placed on players who have achieved many kills and assists without dying in the meantime. This grants additional gold to the corresponding player upon their death. In addition, all players will permanently receive small amounts of gold, which will increase as the game progresses. Gold can be used to buy items in the store that have a positive effect on the champion, for example armor, attack damage, ability strength, healing potions. Many items available in the store can be made from a certain number of individual pieces. An item can be made up of a number of different sub-assemblies and has a specific, usually unique, passive ability when upgraded. This passive ability is granted in addition to the item's attributes and supports the player with special abilities. Recently, Mythic Items have been introduced. A champion can only buy one mythical item per game. Mythical Items grant extra stats when Legendary Items are purchased. A game usually lasts about 25 to 55 minutes, depending on the game mode, map and number of players. It is possible to end a game early by surrendering. After 15 minutes of play, surrender is possible by agreement of all team members. After 20 minutes of play, an agreement of at least 70% of the team members is sufficient.</p>

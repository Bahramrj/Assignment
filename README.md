title: League of Legends**\

Game preparation\
Before starting a round, a player can search for teammates and opponents using an automatic matchmaking system. Alternatively, for a free game, a player can search for his teammates manually or invite them from his friends list. In this case, the matchmaking system is not used. Once enough players have been found for both teams (five per team in classic mode), all players in the match enter the champion selection together. Here, each player can select his desired champion, a game character with individual abilities, strengths and weaknesses. The player thereby fulfills the role of the summoner, who summons and controls this figure. Depending on the game mode, all players can choose at the same time or alternately per team. In alternating selection mode, one champion can also be "banished" from each of the 5 members of each team prior to selection. Banned champions cannot be selected by any of the teams. In addition to the champion, two summoner spells can be selected for use in the game. These are independent of the chosen champion. In addition, various skill enhancements, the runes, can be selected to adapt the champion to the individual game strategy.

Gameplay\
The playing field itself is divided into two similar halves, each of which is assigned to a team. Depending on the map and game mode, there are several paths between the two halves of the map. The paths are generally referred to as lanes in game jargon, with the area between them often summarized as the "jungle". In this are various neutral monsters (not belonging to any team), i.e. members of both teams can defeat them. Some of these monsters grant a champion - in addition to experience and gold - unique, time-limited enhancements. The playing field is only revealed at the places where a player, a tower, minions or a so-called "eye" (English ward) of the own team is currently located. An eye is a one-time use item that creates a small area of visibility for a limited time. The rest is hidden in the so-called fog of war, i.e. not visible to players. Two teams of usually five players compete against each other. The two teams start on opposite sides of a map near a main building called the Nexus. The goal is to destroy the opposing Nexus. The Nexus is defended by the opposing team as well as computer-controlled units and towers. The minions are sent in the direction of the enemy main building and follow the respective "lanes", they do not run through the "jungle". They also attack every enemy unit and building on their way to the enemy Nexus. There are inhibitors in addition to the nexus. If they are destroyed, stronger minions will appear on the opposite side of the corresponding "lane" - so-called supervassals. After several minutes, the inhibitors are rebuilt and the supervassals of the respective lane are no longer summoned. To prevent the game from progressing too quickly, the nexus cannot be attacked directly. First, on at least one "lane", all enemy towers, the outer, inner and the inhibitor tower, as well as the inhibitor itself, must be destroyed. Then the two nexus towers, which are independent of a "lane", become attackable, and only after their destruction can the nexus also be attacked. By killing minions, monsters, enemy champions and destroying enemy towers, your own champion gains experience, i.e. they reach a higher level where new abilities can be unlocked or these can be improved, whereby these are determined by the respective champion and are not completely freely selectable.
   
Furthermore, various basic attributes of the respective champion are improved. In addition, there is still a certain amount of gold for players who perform the killing blow on an enemy unit. In order to balance the two teams, a bounty is placed on players who have achieved many kills and assists without dying in the meantime. This grants additional gold to the corresponding player upon their death. In addition, all players will permanently receive small amounts of gold, which will increase as the game progresses. Gold can be used to buy items in the store that have a positive effect on the champion, for example armor, attack damage, ability strength, healing potions. Many items available in the store can be made from a certain number of individual pieces. An item can be made up of a number of different sub-assemblies and has a specific, usually unique, passive ability when upgraded. This passive ability is granted in addition to the item's attributes and supports the player with special abilities. Recently, Mythic Items have been introduced. A champion can only buy one mythical item per game. Mythical Items grant extra stats when Legendary Items are purchased. A game usually lasts about 25 to 55 minutes, depending on the game mode, map and number of players. It is possible to end a game early by surrendering. After 15 minutes of play, surrender is possible by agreement of all team members. After 20 minutes of play, an agreement of at least 70% of the team members is sufficient.\

title: Teamfight Tactics**\

 Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.\
Gameplay\
Based on Dota Auto Chess, a mod for Dota 2, the game centers around eight players who construct teams to fight one another and be the last player standing. The battlefield consists of hexagons, where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for that round, or else paired against computer-controlled enemies. In the rounds against computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, or items that the player can use. Health lost from losing a round is calculated with a combination of set damage per round and how many units an opponent had still alive. The game consist of stages and rounds. Each stage consist of seven rounds with the exception of stage 1. Stage 1 consist of three rounds of computer- controlled enemies. On round four of each stage, there is a feature called the "Carousel", in which players have access to a free rotation of units with random equipped items to select from. During these shared rounds, the two players with the lowest health are able to choose their units first, followed by the next two players with the lowest health, and so on. If there are players with similar health points, the game will randomly choose the order. On the last round of each stage, players will face computer-controlled enemies. Players accumulate gold during rounds and can save it to build interest, which further increases their income per round. Players can also gain additional income per round by either winning multiple rounds in a row or losing multiple rounds in a row. With this gold, they can either reroll the five units automatically offered to them in their shop at the start of each round or purchase experience points to increase their level. The higher a player's level, the more units they can place on the board, which can also be augmented by certain items, and the higher the average rarity of units in the shop. Each unit is able to be upgraded if additional copies of the same unit are found in the shop or Shared Draft. Upgrading a champion increases their maximum health and attack damage. With some exceptions, units have both a health bar and a mana bar. Taking damage from enemy attacks or abilities will lower a unit's health but increase a unit's mana. When a unit's health reaches zero, they are effectively removed from the round. When a unit's mana bar is full, they cast a unique ability. Some units may start the round with some percentage of their mana bar full, but units generally start the round with no mana. Synergies are activated by a team composition that makes use of one or multiple units with the same trait. Each unit has two or three traits and the effective combination of units will activate synergies that benefit the player. Synergies will usually fall into three categories: effects that strengthen allies, effects that weaken enemies, and miscellaneous effects. Each "set" of Teamfight Tactics corresponds to a unique unit pool, collection of synergies, and usable items. Teamfight Tactics periodically updates its unit roster. Every three months there is a partial rotation, referred by Riot Games developers as a mid-set update, rotating out traits and units which are problematic. As Teamfight Tactics is a game mode of League of Legends, its patch numbering follows the same as its parent game rather than being labelled differently.\

title: DayZ**\

Storyline\
The player starts randomly on the map, but usually on a stretch of beach in the fictional post-Soviet state of Chernarus or Livonia (paid DLC), whose inhabitants have been turned into zombies by an unexplained viral disease. As a survivor, the player must fight his way unarmed and with few supplies into the interior of the country to find food, weapons, ammunition, survival equipment and medicine. In the process, he encounters zombies on the one hand and other survivors on the other. The latter are controlled by other players, just like the player himself, and can thus be both friendly and hostile. With friendly characters you can form alliances; with bandits you will be attacked and robbed. This circumstance requires tactical, foresighted and prudent action, which creates its own tension and atmosphere.
Description\
DayZ is an open-world game of the survival horror genre, there are no game objectives in the real sense. The only goal is to fight your way through in order to survive. The player must move through the 225 km2 game world as quietly as possible for the most part, since walking or running generates noise, which attracts zombies that are in the vicinity. Loud gunshots also attract the attention of the zombies. However, by using silenced and silent weapons such as a hatchet, chisel or crossbow, the player can defend himself without attracting attention. On wide plains, one is more visible to zombies; ducking or crawling reduces visibility. If a survivor is injured, he must bandage his wounds and receive a transfusion from another player if blood loss is high. Broken bones must be treated with morphine, or a splint made of wooden sticks and bandages. After fierce fights and severe injuries, the player may panic or be in pain. Panic is represented by a symbol, while pain leads to strong trembling, which makes aiming the weapon enormously difficult. Pain can be treated with painkillers. In addition, it is possible to catch a cold and develop a fever. In order to warm up or recover, campfires can be lit, heat packs or precautionary warm clothes can be used, if found. Additionally, the player is forced to eat and drink regularly to avoid starving or dying of thirst. The vast terrain is bordered by sea to the south and east. If the player crosses the border to the north or west, he enters a monotonous grassy landscape that no longer has any traces of civilization or vegetation. Since the player will not find any food in this endless wasteland, he will be forced to turn back sooner or later. There are weather effects in the game world, which also have an influence on the gameplay. When it rains, the body temperature slowly drops, which can cause a cold or diseases like cholera, dysentery and hepatitis; when it's sunny, the game character warms up. Furthermore, there are day and night changes. At night, flashlights, bengal flares, glow sticks or night vision devices provide visibility, although the former can in turn attract unwanted attention. Communication with other players is possible via a voice chat function or hand signals. The death of the character is permanent. The player loses his equipment and starts from scratch again. However, since the character's corpse is not lost, all items can be picked up again unless another player has already done so or the corpse has disappeared (aka despawned).\
